Hellow, my name is Israel, this proyect was the first website that I made in high school for a final proyect, with HTML5, CSS3 and a JavaScript.
I used a template and then I modified for to look as I wanted it to look according to the company I created for this specific project. 
The tampleate i taked from html5up.net.

Readme from HTML5UP:

This is Helios, a brand new site template for HTML5 UP. It's clean, modern, and designed
to take advantage of larger (well, wider) displays while still being capable of gracefully
scaling down to fit all manner of smaller ones.
